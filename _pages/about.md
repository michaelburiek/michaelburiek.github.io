I graduated from Brigham Young University with a B.S. in Accounting and a Minor in Computer Science. Iâ€™m actively seeking opportunities to contribute to research efforts in Computer Science as preparation for graduate-level work. Iâ€™m especially interested in projects involving AI for scientific discovery, large language models, and machine reasoning. If your lab is open to new contributors, Iâ€™d love to connect.

- Developing enterprise-scale Generative AI applications
- Training and deploying ML models in Databricks environments

## Research Interests

For my graduate studies in Computer Science, I'm particularly interested in:

- **AI for scientific discovery:** Leveraging artificial intelligence to accelerate breakthroughs across scientific disciplines
- **Understanding and improving large language/multi-modal models:** Investigating attack and defense mechanisms, evaluation and benchmarking methodologies, and addressing uncertainty and hallucination
- **Machine reasoning and generation with large (language/multi-modal) models:** Exploring compositional constrained generation, reasoning and planning, and inference-time control

## Skills

- **Programming Languages**: C++, Java, Python
- **ML/AI Frameworks**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face
- **Cloud & Infrastructure**: Azure, AWS, Databricks
